            <h1>Artist Statment</h1>
            <p>When I was a child, art was my saving grace; as an adult it is the reason I became and continue to grow as an artist/researcher/teacher. Accordingly, I make work that is autobiographical, exploratory, and based deeply in process. I explore materials and concepts. I see my work as a visual connection between what I am, what my beliefs and curiosities are, where I am going and how the path, I am on intersects with the world around me. I feel deeply connected to place, people and the complex relationships between them. One can consistently find a marriage of chaos and order in my work that is carefully fashioned to remind the viewer of this tension.</p>
            <p>The relationship between the artist, artwork, and the viewer is vital to the ideas and responses sparked by meaningful aesthetic encounters. Meaning that flows outward while I work with a set of assumptions that evolve and develop through my biographical and cultural experiences.
However, my temperament, my space in relation to others, my biology, and my biography surface in my art making which problematize meaning making for public communication. Therefore, meaning is not static but open to multiple views and compatible contradictions. I catch glimpses of myself, who I have been as an artist, who I wish to be as a teacher, who I will become as a researcher; frozen reflexive moments that I can visually record and build on without knowing that I am doing it.
</p>
            <p>I strive to overlap creative divergence with features of connected knowing in my artwork. Understanding connected knowing as a form of critical knowing that is ally oriented and embraces empathy as an approach of friendliness and a willingness to listen and speak from the heart. And creative divergence as the cultivation of an open meditative approach that promotes a mind that is both full and empty. Thus, I deliberately display emergent moments of artistic creation for viewers to consider how our experiences merge and diverge.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, I engage in the artistic process to understand my subjective experiences and to promote the creative experiences of others. I make art to make meaning. For this reason, my most recent artwork exists as an exploration of art making as transformative, to understand my research, my teaching, and myself. Change and transformation are interwoven concepts with art at the heart of that concept.</p>
            <p>In summation, I create art to enhance my own human understanding and to find greater ways to contribute to the world as an artist/researcher/teacher through the life I live and the marks I make in creative partnership with others. My end goal is to create work that is honest. At times I hope it is also considered beautiful. This is all true and good, but it doesnâ€™t capture the energy, the fluid playfulness and spirit embodied by my work. I love entering my studio every day, walking in and making something from nothing.</p>
